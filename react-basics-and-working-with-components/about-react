React is all about components

So why use components? What's so special about them?

** Components are basically just javascript functions **

1. Reusability
   Don't repeat yourself
2. Seperation of concerns
   Don't do too many things in one and the same place (function)

React uses a declarative approach

- Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual Javascript DOM instructions
